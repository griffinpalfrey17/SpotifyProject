Project Outline 

Landing on guiding questions:

1. Does music change taste as you grow up: Hypothesis, no. Justification: reminiscence bump. 
Self-centered memories: the reminiscence bump and the self (Clare J. Rathbone, Chris J.A. Moulin, Martin A. Conway)
 - Autobiographical memories (AM) not distributed equally over our life span. The majority come from ages 10-30, the primary period of life development. 
 - "Our very sense of identity depends on being able to recall personal history" (p. 1403)
Why? 
 - the reminiscence bump is based robustly on the age of the rememberer at the time of encoding and not on the age of the memories. So if the music I listen to right now, on average, is about 6.5 years old, then when I am older I will still be listening to the same music. Explains why my dad played the Rolling Stones every chance he could growing up, and now my brother and I listen to it still–even if the psychological reasons are not the same. It is part of our formative years. 
 - "93% of vivid life memories were either of first-time experiences of of unique events" (p. 1403)
 - "one's adult identity emerges during late adolescence and early adulthood" (Erikson, 1950, see bibliography)
 - "the reminiscence bump relates to a time in an individuals life that is critical for the formation and maintenance of a stable self" (p. 1404)
AM and self: 
 - when people write things about themselves... "I am a good brother" for instance, the memories associated with this view are often very closely related in time. For instance, you remember being a good brother sligtly before this became a defining part of your character, not after. 
 Counterargument:
 Circumstances that result in major changes to your identity, regardless of when they occur, can result in a heightened retrieval of memories from that time. War, loss, immigration, etc. 


2. What drives music preference, and what controls the magnitude to which we prefer a certain genre?
Argument a: Preferences are shaped based on several factors: characteristics of the music (like rhymth, pitch); familiarity and repeated listening, the listeners affective experiences while listening to music, social influences (all from Finnäs); personality of the listener (Renfrow and Gosling, 2003); the listener's physiological parameters (McNamara and Ballard, 1999), and innate auditory preferences (McDermott and Hauser, 2005; Trehub, Schellenberg, and Hill, 1997; Umemoto, 1997).
2.1: Why do people actually listen to music and why do they develop a certain taste? 
Argument b: Music as function. 
 - "Our daily lives are thought to be driven by certain needs that lead us to a state of subjective well-being or hedonism, and music is just one thing that brings us a bit closer to this end every day" (p.280)
 - "Young people use music to explore, express, and tighten their identities and to communicate their personal values, ambitions, beliefs, and perceptions of the world and themselves" (p.280)
 - Represents a symbolic border against other groups. 
Music, in many ways, is a way of asserting yourself without screaming it to the world. It is a way of expressing yourself, a way of defining yourself without having to say anything or show someone. It is, in many ways, the scapegoat of confrontation. A way of slowly cultivating an identity that is unique to you... and someone you want to share an identity with. 

"Music is highly diagnostic for exploring the personality of others" (p.281)
 - Can admiring someone's elses personality bias your taste in music? Certainly. 
 - This is an idea I want to explore more. How do we use music to explore, judge, critique others. How does it act as a border between groups? Is this apparent in any of the visualization I have created?

 2.2: Different styles yield different reasons for listening. IE different genres have different functions. 
 Study 1: Questionnaire by Thomas Schäfer and Peter Sedlmeier (2009): 170 participants named every genre they could think of. 74 total. Included only the ones that were named by at least 10% of the participants. This resulted in 25 genres. General trends:
  - Negative correlation between importance of music and age (-.24)
  - Negative correlation between duration of time spent listening to music and age (-.15)

Study 2: 507 participants, age 11 to 50 responded to an online survey. Gave preferences for each genre on a scale of 1-10, then asked to name their favorite genre and to rate how much they agreed with WHY they liked it, ie. the function of the music. "I like [blank] because ...
 - It helps me forget 
 - it helps me remember 
Split into 6 "dimensions":
    1. Sophisticated: classical, jazz, blues, swing (superior or ambitious)
    2. Electronic: techno, house, dance, etc (produced with computers or sound machines)
    3. Rock: Punk, metal, Rock, alternative, gothic, etc (loud, fast, unconventional)
    4. Rap: Hip hop, Rap, raggae, etc (offbeat rhymths and a dominant MC voice) 
    5. Pop: Pop, soul, R 'n' B, Gospel (smooth rhythms and sentimental vocals)
    6. Beat, folk, and country: Beat music, Folk, Country, Rock n Roll (traditional, accoustic, simple structure)

    Most common function people ascribed to their music was the ability to put them in a good mood, followed by the possibility to chill and tune things out, get energized, reminisce, and perceive one's thoughts and feelings. Implies perceived benefits of favorite music had to do with mood, arousal, and emotion. 

But the highest correlation between function and preference was "helps me express my identity" and "helps me express my values"

The Key Distinction:
Surface vs. Deep Motivation:

People think they choose music for emotional regulation (surface)
But they actually choose music for identity construction (deep)

Why This Matters for Your Research:
Predictive Power: Identity/values are better predictors of music preference than mood functions
Stability: Identity-driven preferences likely persist longer than mood-driven ones
Social Psychology: Music becomes a way to communicate "who we are" without words

I think this finding combined with the reminiscence bump is a powerful way to understand music habits at a young age. The reminiscence bump suggests that as we our in formative years, we are building our identity more so than in later years. We are experiencing things for the first time, we are making more mistakes, we are learning more about ourselves. We cultivate an identity through an abundance of unique experiences, which explains why our taste in music is changing so frequently during this time, as a lot of my data over the 6 years will tell us. For a lot of people, you're identity crystalizes as you get older: you stop experiencing unique things all the time; you stop trying to put borders around yourself and you start to accept who you are. What can we learn from my data that suggests this? We can see that my music taste is very concentrated in rap and then country, and then settles into a more pop and indie taste. What does it say that my taste in music is becoming more diverse as I get older? Does it mean that I am more open to new experiences and less concerned with cultivating an identity that is unique to me? What does it say when I completely stop listening to some type of music and continue to listen to listen to others, like mike.. Also, how do artists transcend generations? Why does my dad still listen to the Rolling Stones? Becuase he listened to them when he was younger, within the reminiscence bump. Now he still listens to them because they are at the core of his identity. Of course, he played the Rolling Stones every weekend growing up, so now it equally part of my identity and will likely be part of my kids' identity.
