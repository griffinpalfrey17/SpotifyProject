## üéØ Research Questions

1. **Does music taste change as you grow up?**
   - Hypothesis: No, due to reminiscence bump effect
   - Music preferences formed during ages 10-30 persist throughout life

2. **What drives music preference and genre magnitude?**
   - Identity construction vs. emotional regulation
   - Social influences and personality factors

## üìà Key Research Findings

### Artist Loyalty Patterns
- **mike.** appears in all 6 years (47 total songs) - core identity artist
- **Morgan Wallen** peaks early (2021) then declines - possible phase
- **Zach Bryan** shows recent emergence (2022-2024) - new identity formation

### Musical Diversity Evolution
- Measured by unique artists per year
- Tracks identity crystallization vs. exploration phases
- Higher diversity may indicate continued identity formation

### Genre/Dimension Shifts
- Maps onto identity development stages
- Tracks movement between musical dimensions
- Identifies stable vs. transitional preferences

---

## üî¨ Theoretical Framework

### Reminiscence Bump Theory
- Memories from ages 10-30 are most vivid and persistent
- Music preferences formed during this period remain stable
- Explains why formative-year music persists throughout life

### Identity vs. Mood Functions
- **Surface motivation:** Emotional regulation (what people think)
- **Deep motivation:** Identity construction (actual driver)
- Music serves as non-verbal identity communication

### Musical Identity Formation
- Music as symbolic boundary creation
- Preference patterns reveal identity development
- Artist loyalty indicates core identity elements

## üéµ Core Insights Summary

1. **Identity Persistence:** Artists like mike. appearing consistently across all years suggest core identity formation
2. **Preference Evolution:** Different peak years for different artists reveal identity development phases
3. **Musical Diversity:** Changes in artist variety indicate ongoing vs. crystallized identity formation
4. **Genre Stability:** Dimension analysis reveals which musical elements remain stable vs. changeable
